                <p>Miami's Varsity Esports has stood out as one of the leading pioneers in the collegiate

                    national recognition.
                    Our young program has already compiled many achievements, including winning the inaugural National
                    Association of
                    Collegiate Esports Overwatch Championship. Our program prides itself in helping players to develop
                    and hone their skills
                    as players to compete amongst the top national competition. In addition to our five varsity squads,
                    our Hatchery features
                    players training and fine-tuning skills to prepare for the varsity level. </p>

                <p>In addition to competing with the top collegiate Esports players in the country, our academic
                    programs in the
                    Department of Emerging Technologies in Business and Design are nationally acclaimed, preparing
                    students to enter this exploding industry.
                    The department is committed to providing opportunities that interactive media present through
                    hands-on, interactive and project-based courses and experiences,
                    where students are encouraged to experiment, innovate and collaborate. We offer undergraduate,
                    graduate, and graduate-certificate programs.
